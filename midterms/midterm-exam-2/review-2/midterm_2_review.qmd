## Instructions

The midterm will consist of 7-12 in-class questions and 2-3 take-home questions. The questions will cover the topics and packages that we have learned so far in the course and some that we will talk about this week. To prepare for the midterm, you should review the lecture notes, the assignments, and this review. You should also write out all the functions that you know for each package and explain what they do and how to use them.

You will have 50 minutes to complete the in-class questions during the class time. The in-class questions will be a mix of multiple choice, open ended, and code-based questions. 

You will have until Monday March 4 at 7:00 am to complete the take-home questions. The take-home questions will be more challenging and require you to apply your skills and knowledge to new problems. You will need to write and run your code in R.

Please make sure that you follow the academic integrity policy and do not copy or share your answers with anyone else. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me by email or learning hours.

# Questions

![Database schema](https://mystery.knightlab.com/schema.png)


## Description of Database 

Northwestern University's Knight lab created a SQL murder mystery to help users sharpen their database skills by solving the crime that happened at SQL city. There are tables with different pieces of information - social media checkins, people, drivers licenses, crime scene reports, police interviews, and more. 


## Use the following information to answer questions 1-4:

```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gato365/stat331-calpoly-gato365/master/practice-activities/data/sql-murder-setup.R"
if (!"purrr" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("purrr")
source(url)


```



1. **Calculate the Average Salary of Silver Members**: Determine the mean salary for all individuals classified as silver membership holders.

```{r}

```


2. **Visualize the Gym Duration for Gold and Regular Members by Month**: Create a plot that compares the average duration of gym visits for gold and regular members across the months of January, February, and March across all years.

```{r}

```

3. **Average Salary for Unique Attendees of Specific Events**: Calculate the average salary for unique individuals who have attended either the "SQL Symphony Concert" or the event titled "Dealing with Failure is Easy." Ensure that each individual is counted only once in the calculation.

```{r}

```


4. **Profile and Gym Habits of a Specific Individual**:
   - **Identification and Basic Information**: Identify the individual with a person ID of "80571" and retrieve their name, salary, and address.
   - **Gym Attendance Visualization**: Plot the frequency of their gym visits over a specified period.
   - **Weekly Gym Time Visualization**: Illustrate the amount of time they spend at the gym each week through a graphical representation.
   
```{r}

```

-----------------------

Get experimental data from: 

```{r}
url <-  url_base <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gato365/stat331-calpoly-gato365/master/midterms/data/experimental_data.csv"
experimental_data_df <- read.csv(url)
```



5. **Transform Experimental Data and Analyze Average Height by Time Point**
   - Convert the provided experimental data to a wider format, then calculate the average height for each time point. 
   - Ensure that the data structure is appropriately adjusted to facilitate this analysis.

6. **Extracting Vehicle Names, Pivoting Data, and Analyzing Averages**
   - First, extract the vehicle names from the `mtcars` dataset as a separate variable. (*Hint: there is a function that does this*) Next, select only the `mpg` (miles per gallon) and `hp` (horsepower) columns for further analysis. 
   - Convert this selected data into a longer format, where each row represents a single measurement type (either `mpg` or `hp`) for each vehicle. Finally, calculate the average value of `mpg` and `hp` across all vehicles. 
   - This task demonstrates how to reshape data for specific analytical needs and emphasizes the utility of pivoting for comparative analyses.

-----------------------


7.  Write a function named greet_time that takes one argument, time, representing the hour of the day (0-23). The function should return "Good morning!" if the time is less than 12, "Good afternoon!" if the time is between 12 and 18 (inclusive), and "Good evening!" for times greater than 18.

8. 

A weighted average is a fundamental concept in statistics and computer science, crucial for situations where different data points contribute unequally to the final average. Unlike a simple arithmetic mean, where each value in a set contributes equally, a weighted average multiplies each data point by a corresponding weight before summing them up, and the result is divided by the total of the weights. This method is essential in fields like finance for calculating the average return of an investment portfolio where different investments have different stakes, or in educational grading systems where different assignments or exams contribute differently to a final grade.

The calculate_weighted_average function in R, as shown, implements this concept by taking two parallel vectors: values representing the data points and weights representing their corresponding importance. The function carefully handles special cases such as the presence of NA values and situations where all weights are zero, ensuring the weighted average calculation is both accurate and robust. This approach allows for more nuanced data analysis, enabling statisticians and computer scientists to derive meaningful averages that reflect the varying significance of each data point within a dataset.

**Below is a function intended to calculate the weighted average of a vector, but it contains an error and lacks consideration for a specific edge case. The function takes two arguments: values, a numeric vector of values, and weights, a numeric vector of weights corresponding to those values. Identify and correct the mistake, and modify the function to handle the case where all weights are zero, which should return NA since a weighted average cannot be calculated.**
```{r}
calculate_weighted_average <- function(values, weights) {

  
  weighted_sum <- max(values * weights, na.rm = TRUE)
  total_weight <- mean(weights, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  return(total_weight)
}

# Example 1 usage:
values <- c(1, 2, 3, NA)
weights <- c(0, 0, 0, 0)  
calculate_weighted_average(values, weights)

# Example 2 usage:
values <- c(1, 2, 3, NA)
weights <- c(0.1, 0.4, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1)  
calculate_weighted_average(values, weights)


```

9. Explain what the following function does. Specifically, describe the roles of {{}}, !! and  := within the function.

```{r}
dynamic_filter_rename <- function(data, filter_var, new_name, threshold) {
  df <- data %>%
    filter({{ filter_var }} > threshold) %>%
    rename(!!new_name := {{ filter_var }})
  return(df)
}
```


10.  Create a function named `apply_percentile_rank` that takes a data frame and a vector of column names, then calculates the percentile rank for the values in those columns. The percentile rank of a value is the percentage of observations in the data set that are less than or equal to that value.
